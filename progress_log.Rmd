## Dataset details 

## Data preprocessing

- **ATAC-seq:** raw 10x sequencing reads were preprocessed to call peaks with Cellranger (v ...). For aligment with scRNA-seq data we need to reduce ATAC peaks to gene-level features. We do this as in the Seurat pipeline, summing all counts in peaks within gene bodies + 2kb upstream. 
- **RNA-seq**
