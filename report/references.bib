  abstract = {Chromatin state and the single cell
Identifying the chromatin state of any single cell, which may or may not have a different function or represent different stages relative to others collected within any single culture, experiment, or tissue, has been challenging. Cusanovitch et al. skirted previously identified technological limitations to identify regions of accessible chromatin at single-cell resolution. Combinatorial cellular indexing, a strategy for multiplex barcoding of thousands of single cells per experiment, was successfully used to investigate the genome-wide chromatin accessibility landscape in each of over 15,000 single cells.
Science, this issue p. 910
Technical advances have enabled the collection of genome and transcriptome data sets with single-cell resolution. However, single-cell characterization of the epigenome has remained challenging. Furthermore, because cells must be physically separated before biochemical processing, conventional single-cell preparatory methods scale linearly. We applied combinatorial cellular indexing to measure chromatin accessibility in thousands of single cells per assay, circumventing the need for compartmentalization of individual cells. We report chromatin accessibility profiles from more than 15,000 single cells and use these data to cluster cells on the basis of chromatin accessibility landscapes. We identify modules of coordinately regulated chromatin accessibility at the level of single cells both between and within cell types, with a scalable method that may accelerate progress toward a human cell atlas.
Combinatorial indexing can identify chromatin states at single-cell resolution.

  title = {A Joint Model of Unpaired Data from {{scRNA}}-Seq and Spatial Transcriptomics for Imputing Missing Gene Expression Measurements},
  abstract = {Spatial studies of transcriptome provide biologists with gene expression maps of heterogeneous and complex tissues. However, most experimental protocols for spatial transcriptomics suffer from the need to select beforehand a small fraction of genes to be quantified over the entire transcriptome. Standard single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is more prevalent, easier to implement and can in principle capture any gene but cannot recover the spatial location of the cells. In this manuscript, we focus on the problem of imputation of missing genes in spatial transcriptomic data based on (unpaired) standard scRNA-seq data from the same biological tissue. Building upon domain adaptation work, we propose gimVI, a deep generative model for the integration of spatial transcriptomic data and scRNA-seq data that can be used to impute missing genes. After describing our generative model and an inference procedure for it, we compare gimVI to alternative methods from computational biology or domain adaptation on real datasets and outperform Seurat Anchors, Liger and CORAL to impute held-out genes.},

As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a strategy to {"}anchor{"} diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize \emph{in situ} gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns. Our work presents a strategy for the assembly of harmonized references and transfer of information across datasets.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) combines unbiased single-cell transcriptome measurements with surface protein quantification comparable to flow cytometry, the gold standard for cell type identification. However, current analysis pipelines cannot address the two primary challenges of CITE-seq data: combining both modalities in a shared latent space that harnesses the power of the paired measurements, and handling the technical artifacts of the protein measurement, which is obscured by non-negligible background noise. Here we present Total Variational Inference (totalVI), a fully probabilistic end-to-end framework for normalizing and analyzing CITE-seq data, based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. In totalVI, the mRNA and protein measurements for each cell are generated from a low-dimensional latent random variable unique to that cell, representing its cellular state. totalVI uses deep neural networks to specify conditional distributions. By leveraging advances in stochastic variational inference, it scales easily to millions of cells. Explicit modeling of nuisance factors enables totalVI to produce denoised data in both domains, as well as a batch-corrected latent representation of cells for downstream analysis tasks.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We applied a combinatorial indexing assay, sci-ATAC-seq, to profile genome-wide chromatin accessibility in {$\sim$}100,000 single cells from 13 adult mouse tissues. We identify 85 distinct patterns of chromatin accessibility, most of which can be assigned to cell types, and {$\sim$}400,000 differentially accessible elements. We use these data to link regulatory elements to their target genes, to define the transcription factor grammar specifying each cell type, and to discover in~vivo correlates of heterogeneity in accessibility within cell types. We develop a technique for mapping single cell gene expression data to single-cell chromatin accessibility data, facilitating the comparison of atlases. By intersecting mouse chromatin accessibility with human genome-wide association summary statistics, we identify cell-type-specific enrichments of the heritability signal for hundreds of complex traits. These data define the in~vivo landscape of the regulatory genome for common mammalian cell types at single-cell resolution.},
