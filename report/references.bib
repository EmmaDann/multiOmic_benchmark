  abstract = {Single cell RNA-seq makes possible the investigation of variability in gene expression among cells, and dependence of variation on cell type. Statistical inference methods for such analyses must be scalable, and ideally interpretable. We present an approach based on a modification of a recently published highly scalable variational autoencoder framework that provides interpretability without sacrificing much accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach enables identification of gene programs in massive datasets. Our strategy, namely the learning of factor models with the auto-encoding variational Bayes framework, is not domain specific and may be of interest for other applications.},

Ectopic expression of combinations of transcription factors (TFs) can drive direct lineage conversion, thereby reprogramming a somatic cell’s identity. To determine the molecular mechanisms by which Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT) induce conversion from a cardiac fibroblast toward an induced cardiomyocyte, we performed comprehensive transcriptomic, DNA-occupancy, and epigenomic interrogation throughout the reprogramming process. Integration of these datasets identified new TFs involved in cardiac reprogramming and revealed context-specific roles for GMT, including the ability of Mef2c and Tbx5 to independently promote chromatin remodeling at previously inaccessible sites. We also find evidence for cooperative facilitation and refinement of each TF’s binding profile in a combinatorial setting. A reporter assay employing newly defined regulatory elements confirmed that binding of a single TF can be sufficient for gene activation, suggesting that co-binding events do not necessarily reflect synergy. These results shed light on fundamental mechanisms by which combinations of TFs direct lineage conversion.},

In this review, we discuss applications of this new breed of analysis approaches in regulatory genomics and cellular imaging. We provide background of what deep learning is, and the settings in which it can be successfully applied to derive biological insights. In addition to presenting specific applications and providing tips for practical use, we also highlight possible pitfalls and limitations to guide computational biologists when and how to make the most use of this new technology.},

Single-cell transcriptomics has transformed our ability to characterize cell states, but deep biological understanding requires more than a taxonomic listing of clusters. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a strategy to “anchor” diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns. Our work presents a strategy for the assembly of harmonized references and transfer of information across datasets.},

Defining cell types requires integrating diverse single-cell measurements from multiple experiments and biological contexts. To flexibly model single-cell datasets, we developed LIGER, an algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of cell identity. We applied it to four diverse and challenging analyses of human and mouse brain cells. First, we defined region-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Second, we analyzed expression in the human substantia nigra, comparing cell states in specific donors and relating cell types to those in the mouse. Third, we integrated in situ and single-cell expression data to spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse frontal cortex. Finally, we jointly defined mouse cortical cell types using single-cell RNA-seq and DNA methylation profiles, revealing putative mechanisms of cell-type-specific epigenomic regulation. Integrative analyses using LIGER promise to accelerate investigations of cell-type definition, gene regulation, and disease states.},

We also discuss how anatomic compartments undergo distinct age-associated changes in T~cell subset composition and function over a lifetime.

  abstract = {Generation of the first T lymphocytes in the human embryo involves the emergence, migration, and thymus seeding of lymphoid progenitors together with concomitant thymus organogenesis, which is the initial step to establish the entire adaptive immune system. However, the cellular and molecular programs regulating this process remain unclear. We constructed a single-cell transcriptional landscape of human early T lymphopoiesis by using cells from multiple hemogenic and hematopoietic sites spanning embryonic and fetal stages. Among heterogenous early thymic progenitors, one subtype shared common features with a subset of lymphoid progenitors in fetal liver that are known as thymus-seeding progenitors. Unbiased bioinformatics analysis identified a distinct type of pre-thymic lymphoid progenitors in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. In parallel, we investigated thymic epithelial cell development and potential cell-cell interactions during thymus organogenesis. Together, our data provide insights into human early T lymphopoiesis that prospectively direct T lymphocyte regeneration, which might lead to development of clinical applications.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Many single-cell sequencing technologies are now available, but it is still difficult to apply multiple sequencing technologies to the same single cell. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised manifold alignment algorithm, MMD-MA, for integrating multiple measurements carried out on disjoint aliquots of a given population of cells. Effectively, MMD-MA performs an \emph{in silico} co-assay by embedding cells measured in different ways into a learned latent space. In the MMD-MA algorithm, single-cell data points from multiple domains are aligned by optimizing an objective function with three components: (1) a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) term to encourage the differently measured points to have similar distributions in the latent space, (2) a distortion term to preserve the structure of the data between the input space and the latent space, and (3) a penalty term to avoid collapse to a trivial solution. Notably, MMD-MA does not require any correspondence information across data modalities, either between the cells or between the features. Furthermore, MMD-MA’s weak distributional requirements for the domains to be aligned allow the algorithm to integrate heterogeneous types of single cell measures, such as gene expression, DNA accessibility, chromatin organization, methylation, and imaging data. We demonstrate the utility of MMD-MA in simulation experiments and using a real data set involving single-cell gene expression and methylation data.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, current analysis pipelines cannot address the two primary challenges of CITE-seq data: combining both modalities in a shared latent space that harnesses the power of the paired measurements, and handling the technical artifacts of the protein measurement, which is obscured by non-negligible background noise. Here we present Total Variational Inference (totalVI), a fully probabilistic end-to-end framework for normalizing and analyzing CITE-seq data, based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. In totalVI, the mRNA and protein measurements for each cell are generated from a low-dimensional latent random variable unique to that cell, representing its cellular state. totalVI uses deep neural networks to specify conditional distributions. By leveraging advances in stochastic variational inference, it scales easily to millions of cells. Explicit modeling of nuisance factors enables totalVI to produce denoised data in both domains, as well as a batch-corrected latent representation of cells for downstream analysis tasks.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we introduce Cicero, an algorithm that identifies co-accessible pairs of DNA elements using single-cell chromatin accessibility data and so connects regulatory elements to their putative target genes. We apply Cicero to investigate how dynamically accessible elements orchestrate gene regulation in differentiating myoblasts. Groups of Cicero-linked regulatory elements meet criteria of "chromatin hubs"—they are enriched for physical proximity, interact with a common set of transcription factors, and undergo coordinated changes in histone marks that are predictive of changes in gene expression. Pseudotemporal analysis revealed that most DNA elements remain in chromatin hubs throughout differentiation. A subset of elements bound by MYOD1 in myoblasts exhibit early opening in a PBX1- and MEIS1-dependent manner. Our strategy can be applied to dissect the architecture, sequence determinants, and mechanisms of \emph{cis}-regulation on a genome-wide scale.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

  abstract = {Human hematopoiesis involves cellular differentiation of multipotent cells into progressively more lineage-restricted states. While the chromatin accessibility landscape of this process has been explored in defined populations, single-cell regulatory variation has been hidden by ensemble averaging. We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to associate transcription factors to chromatin accessibility changes and regulatory elements to target genes through correlations of expression and regulatory element accessibility. Overall, this work provides a framework for integrative exploration of complex regulatory dynamics in a primary human tissue at single-cell resolution.},

  abstract = {Understanding how gene regulatory networks control the progressive restriction of cell fates is a long-standing challenge. Recent advances in measuring gene expression in single cells are providing new insights into lineage commitment. However, the regulatory events underlying these changes remain unclear. Here we investigate the dynamics of chromatin regulatory landscapes during embryogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq)1, we profiled chromatin accessibility in over 20,000 single nuclei from fixed Drosophila melanogaster embryos spanning three landmark embryonic stages: 2–4 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 5 blastoderm nuclei), when each embryo comprises around 6,000 multipotent cells; 6–8 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 10–11), to capture a midpoint in embryonic development when major lineages in the mesoderm and ectoderm are specified; and 10–12 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 13), when each of the embryo’s more than 20,000 cells are undergoing terminal differentiation. Our results show that there is spatial heterogeneity in the accessibility of the regulatory genome before gastrulation, a feature that aligns with future cell fate, and that nuclei can be temporally ordered along developmental trajectories. During mid-embryogenesis, tissue granularity emerges such that individual cell types can be inferred by their chromatin accessibility while maintaining a signature of their germ layer of origin. Analysis of the data reveals overlapping usage of regulatory elements between cells of the endoderm and non-myogenic mesoderm, suggesting a common developmental program that is reminiscent of the mesendoderm lineage in other species2,3,4. We identify 30,075 distal regulatory elements that exhibit tissue-specific accessibility. We validated the germ-layer specificity of a subset of these predicted enhancers in transgenic embryos, achieving an accuracy of 90\%. Overall, our results demonstrate the power of shotgun single-cell profiling of embryos to resolve dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape during development, and to uncover the cis-regulatory programs of metazoan germ layers and cell types.},

ChIP experiments are often used to identify where TFs bind to regulatory elements in the genome, but the requirement of TF-specific antibodies hampers analyses of tens of TFs at multiple loci. Here we tested whether TF binding predictions using ATAC-seq can be used to infer the identity of TFs that bind to functionally validated enhancers of the Cd4, Cd8, and Gata3 genes in thymocytes. We performed ATAC-seq at four distinct stages of development in mouse thymus, probing the chromatin accessibility landscape in double negative (DN), double positive (DP), CD4 single positive (SP4) and CD8 SP (SP8) thymocytes. Integration of chromatin accessibility with TF motifs genome-wide allowed us to infer stage-specific occupied TF binding sites within known and potentially novel regulatory elements. Our results provide genome-wide stage-specific T cell open chromatin profiles, and allow the identification of candidate TFs that drive thymocyte differentiation at each developmental stage.},

We applied a combinatorial indexing assay, sci-ATAC-seq, to profile genome-wide chromatin accessibility in {$\sim$}100,000 single cells from 13 adult mouse tissues. We identify 85 distinct patterns of chromatin accessibility, most of which can be assigned to cell types, and {$\sim$}400,000 differentially accessible elements. We use these data to link regulatory elements to their target genes, to define the transcription factor grammar specifying each cell type, and to discover in~vivo correlates of heterogeneity in accessibility within cell types. We develop a technique for mapping single cell gene expression data to single-cell chromatin accessibility data, facilitating the comparison of atlases. By intersecting mouse chromatin accessibility with human genome-wide association summary statistics, we identify cell-type-specific enrichments of the heritability signal for hundreds of complex traits. These data define the in~vivo landscape of the regulatory genome for common mammalian cell types at single-cell resolution.},

  abstract = {Chromatin state and the single cell
Identifying the chromatin state of any single cell, which may or may not have a different function or represent different stages relative to others collected within any single culture, experiment, or tissue, has been challenging. Cusanovitch et al. skirted previously identified technological limitations to identify regions of accessible chromatin at single-cell resolution. Combinatorial cellular indexing, a strategy for multiplex barcoding of thousands of single cells per experiment, was successfully used to investigate the genome-wide chromatin accessibility landscape in each of over 15,000 single cells.
Science, this issue p. 910
Technical advances have enabled the collection of genome and transcriptome data sets with single-cell resolution. However, single-cell characterization of the epigenome has remained challenging. Furthermore, because cells must be physically separated before biochemical processing, conventional single-cell preparatory methods scale linearly. We applied combinatorial cellular indexing to measure chromatin accessibility in thousands of single cells per assay, circumventing the need for compartmentalization of individual cells. We report chromatin accessibility profiles from more than 15,000 single cells and use these data to cluster cells on the basis of chromatin accessibility landscapes. We identify modules of coordinately regulated chromatin accessibility at the level of single cells both between and within cell types, with a scalable method that may accelerate progress toward a human cell atlas.
Combinatorial indexing can identify chromatin states at single-cell resolution.

  abstract = {Spatial studies of transcriptome provide biologists with gene expression maps of heterogeneous and complex tissues. However, most experimental protocols for spatial transcriptomics suffer from the need to select beforehand a small fraction of genes to be quantified over the entire transcriptome. Standard single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is more prevalent, easier to implement and can in principle capture any gene but cannot recover the spatial location of the cells. In this manuscript, we focus on the problem of imputation of missing genes in spatial transcriptomic data based on (unpaired) standard scRNA-seq data from the same biological tissue. Building upon domain adaptation work, we propose gimVI, a deep generative model for the integration of spatial transcriptomic data and scRNA-seq data that can be used to impute missing genes. After describing our generative model and an inference procedure for it, we compare gimVI to alternative methods from computational biology or domain adaptation on real datasets and outperform Seurat Anchors, Liger and CORAL to impute held-out genes.},

  abstract = {Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data. It includes methods for preprocessing, visualization, clustering, pseudotime and trajectory inference, differential expression testing, and simulation of gene regulatory networks. Its Python-based implementation efficiently deals with data sets of more than one million cells (https://github.com/theislab/Scanpy). Along with Scanpy, we present AnnData, a generic class for handling annotated data matrices (https://github.com/theislab/anndata).},
